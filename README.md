Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

### Overview
The idea is to build a model that will predict the loan approval of an applicant who has applied for a loan. 

### Aim:
Based on different parameters crating a model that can classify whether an applicant Loan will Approve or Not.It is a supervised classification problem.
