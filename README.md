Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

### Overview
The idea is to build a model that will predict the loan approval of an applicant who has applied for a loan . It is based on the userâ€™s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments.

### Aim:
Is to predict whether the applicant will have loan approved or not.So,we have to predict the approval.It is a supervised classification problem.
